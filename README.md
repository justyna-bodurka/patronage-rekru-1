## Commits convention

I was trying to follow conventional commits approach: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

## Remarks to project

- due to not consistant image data, instead of using IMG tag with transformations, background-image has been used
- as bundler is not available, css files are atomized and imported natively by the browser
- JavaScript modules was not used and all script code has been grouped
- One of demands in the task was to make list in 'center' of the page. Two views was introduced into application using "zmie≈Ñ widok" button in header.
- basic error handling for adding to basket and error during fetch is added
